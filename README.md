# Singapore Resale Flat Prices Prediction
## PROBLEM STATEMENT:
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model and deploy it as a user-friendly web application that predicts the resale prices of flats in Singapore. This predictive model will be based on historical data of resale flat transactions, and it aims to assist both potential buyers and sellers in estimating the resale value of a flat.
## Skills Demonstrated

**Data Wrangling and EDA:**
Collect and preprocess resale flat transaction data.
Conduct exploratory data analysis to uncover insights and trends.

**Model Building:**
Choose and train a regression model using historical data.

**Model Deployment:**
Develop an interactive web application using Streamlit.
Deploy the application on the Render platform, ensuring accessibility to users.

## Domain
The project operates within the real estate domain, specifically focusing on the resale flat market in Singapore. It involves understanding the dynamics of this market and applying machine learning to enhance valuation accuracy.
## Project Scope

**1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:**

Collect and clean historical resale flat transaction data from the Singapore Housing and Development Board (HDB).

**2. Feature Engineering:**

Extract relevant features such as town, flat type, storey range, floor area, flat model, and lease commence date. Create additional features to improve prediction accuracy.

**3. Model Selection and Training:**

Choose a suitable regression model and train it on the historical dataset.

**4. Model Evaluation:**

Assess the model's predictive performance using regression metrics like MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R2 Score.

**5. Streamlit Web Application:**

Develop an intuitive web application using Streamlit, allowing users to input flat details for price predictions.

**6. Deployment on Render:**

Deploy the Streamlit application on the Render platform or any cloud platform for online accessibility.

**7. Testing and Validation:**

Thoroughly test the deployed application to ensure accurate predictions and seamless functionality.
